# NEMObeta hrtf

You can read about the NEMO project here:

https://nemohrtf.org/

To launch the initiative, we introduce NEMObeta as a proposal. NEMObeta should be seen as an example of how the repository could look like when the actual set of HRTFs is selected. Also, it aims to motivate constructive criticism towards improving the requirements and the selection process.

NEMObeta has been taken from the HUTUBS database, which is available here: http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-8487 .
